Hello Fellow Art Lover,

<p>This is an invite to participate in an everyday art marathon. The theme will be published on the day itself and displayed on your user panel.</p>

<p>The idea is to make anything around this theme. Be it a sketch, graphic design, photograph, origami, or even a dance interpretation. Get creative. </p>

<p>There is a "Submissions" tab on the website where you can upload your work. You are only allowed to upload a single submission for the same day.</p>

<p>You can view the art work at <a href="http://dailyart.in">Daily Art</a></p>

<p><b>You can now register at {{ URL::route('user.register', $register_code) }}</b></p>

<p>Today's theme is "{{ $theme }}".</p>

<p>Please feel free to send in feedback/suggestions to <a href="mailto:karan@genii.in">karan@genii.in</a></p>

<p>Stay creative!</p>

Regards,<br>
Daily Art
