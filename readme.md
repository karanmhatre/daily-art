# Daily Art
Daily Art is an invite-based system where a daily topic is given and members can submit in their artworks. The system is built using Laravel.

## Deployment
- [Installing PHP & composer](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/quick#local-development-environment "Laravel")
- Install MySQL and create a database named "daily-art"
- Run the Migrations
- Seed the Database with dummy content

## Roadmap
- Gamification units
  - 3 streak opens ability to post for an old topic that you may have missed.
  - 5 streak opens ability to see the next upcoming topic a day in advance.
  - These rewards are collectable.ie. You can save them for later. For example, you can save a 5 streak reward till a Sunday, and complete Monday's topic as well.
- Make "Topic" for each day sticky on scroll. Like name on instagram.
